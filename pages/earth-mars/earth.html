          <h1>This is Earth</h1>
          <p>Earth is <em>the third planet from the Sun</em>, and <em>the only astronomical object known to harbor life</em>. The sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4 ms.[187] The length of the mean solar day in SI seconds is available from the IERS for the periods 1623â€“2005[188] and 1962â€“2005.</p>
          <h2>Orbit and rotation</h2>
          <h3>Rotation</h3>
          <p>Earth's rotation period relative to the Sunâ€”its mean solar dayâ€”is 86,400 seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025 SI seconds). Because Earth's solar day is now *slightly* longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal deceleration, _each day varies between 0 and 2 SI ms longer_.</p>
          <p>
            Earth's rotation period relative to the fixed stars, called its stellar day by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), is 86,164.0989 seconds of mean solar time (UT1), or 23h 56m 4.0989s. Earth's rotation period relative to the precessing or moving mean vernal equinox, misnamed its sidereal day, is 86,164.0905 seconds of mean solar time (UT1) (23h 56m
            4.0905s).
          </p>
          <p>
            Apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west at a rate of 15Â°/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the celestial equator, this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the
            same.
          </p>
          <h3>Orbit</h3>
          <p>
            Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 150 million km (93 million mi) every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one sidereal year. This gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about 1Â°/day, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12 hours. Due to this motion, on average it takes 24 hoursâ€”a solar dayâ€”for Earth to complete a
            full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the meridian.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Moon and Earth orbit a common barycenter every 27.32 days relative to the background stars. When combined with the Earthâ€“Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, the period of the synodic month, from new moon to new moon, is 29.53 days. Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise. Viewed from a vantage
            point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun.
